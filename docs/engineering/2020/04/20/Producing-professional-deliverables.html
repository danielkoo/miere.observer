<div class="post">
<p>It was 2008 when I first received a bad feedback about a job I did. My team was performing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback">360 Degree Feedback</a>. The feedbacks were appaling. I never had that feeling before. Why did people feel like I was a complete fraud? I mean, they complained quite a lot about how they were supposed to maintain such a messy service. One, even asked me if I got any mental problem.</p>
