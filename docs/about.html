  <h2 id="about-this-blog">About This Blog</h2>
<p>This is a blog composed by my personal observations and thoughts. I write about mostly about technology, science and software engineering, but I might write occasionaly about history and politics as well. I shall try my best to keep it as scientific as possible, using facts to support my point of view. Hopefully, you will give me a hand whenever I did a mistake.</p>

<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>

<p>I’m a Lead Software Engineer who has been working in the industry since 2000. I worked as CTO for a small startup a few years ago and helped them to go overseas by providing them an affordable and stable cloud platform capable of handling hundreds of millions of users per day. Since then I’ve been putting myself as the bridge between C-Level stakeholders and technical teams in the companies I’ve been working for, helping them to achieve their KPIs. While my heart is passionate for well crafted and easily maintainable software, which is the reason I’ve been actively coding since then, my brain is motivated on making software development that delivers actual value to my customers.</p>

<p>Due to the experience I got during these years, companies honoured me with the opportunity to talk directly to customers, lead big projects (from inception to conception), hire my teammates, contract external suppliers, lead my own team and also take responsibility for the infrastructure budget and the team cost.</p>

<p>I was fortunate to have the opportunity to work for 16 outstanding companies, either as a consultant or as an employee. This allowed me to evaluate and adopt cutting edge techniques to solve real-world problems like ERP integrations, image processing, HD video streaming, NLP (natural language programming), face recognition, person detection, timeseries analysis (Redshift, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB and DynamoDB), data ingestion and highly-available distributed computation in public cloud computing platforms (like AWS, BlueMix and GCP) - which I think is my speciality. Therefore, I’m very comfortable working on a wide range of programming language ecosystems, although recently I’ve been mostly involved with Java, Kotlin, C (and a bit of C++), Rust, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and Scala.</p>

<p>Pragmatism and focus on delivering value is my compass, which I’ve been using to guide all decisions of my daily routine. It explains why I’m such a big fan of Agile Methodologies, specially Kanban and XP as it encourages us to avoid repetitive effort and helps us to put energy on what keeps the needle moving. Unit Testing is present on any code I write daily. Domain Driven Development, Continuous Deployment, Clean Code and SOLID principles are among the techniques I have mentored my teams, so they can help me to keep our software neat and with little to no bugs.</p>
