It was 2008 when I first received a bad feedback about a job I did. My team was performing
[360 Degree Feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback). The feedbacks were appaling. I never had that feeling before. It came to point I was questioning if people felt like I was a complete fraud. They complains were diverse, most of them quite
harsh and my manager agreed with me on that.
